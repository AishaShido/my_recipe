    <h2>3 project management tips for new <br>developers</h2>
    <p>As a new or <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-become-a-software-engineer">aspiring developer</a>,
        using project management tools can help you keep<br> track of your progress, and even build a portfolio of
        projects to show potential<br> employers. If you’re tired of starting projects but never finishing them, it
        might be time<br> to try a project management tool or two.
    </p>

        <p class="three1">These measures may seem like overkill at first. Still, suppose<br> you’re at the learning
            phase where you’re ready to start<br> building apps and websites for your portfolio. In that case,<br> these
            project management basics can save precious time and<br> energy that would have otherwise been spent on
            miscellaneous<br> administrative tasks.
            <br><br>
            Learning to use these tools and methods will also give you a<br> head start when it comes
            time to work with
            project<br> management tools in professional settings. Generally speaking,<br> if you learn how to use one
            project management tool, you’ll<br> learn how to use them all. Trello, Asana, and Jira are all tools<br>
            used in enterprise settings.

        <h2>1. Use a personal Kanban board: Trello, Asana, and <br>Jira</h2>
        <p>Kanban boards help developers track the progress of their projects by breaking them<br> down into cards
            with
            smaller tasks.</p>
        <p>These cards are then placed in columns on the board, representing the different development<br> stages.
            This
            helps developers track their progress by giving them a visual<br> representation of how far along they
            are
            in the project.</p>
        <p>Kanban boards are a popular way for agile and DevOps teams to organize their daily<br> work <a
                href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards">[1]</a>, and can be a great way for new
            developers
            to commit to getting their projects<br> across the finish line!</p>
        <p>There are many different Kanban boards available, and three popular ones are Trello, Asana, and Jira.</p>
        <p>Trello is a great option for new developers. It’s simple to use and has a free tier that<br> allows you
            to
            create an unlimited number of boards with up to 10 team members. Once<br> you get the hang of it, you
            can
            try out more feature-rich options like Asana or Jira.</p>
        <p>Jira is more commonly used in enterprise settings, so if you want to work at a large,<br> company,
            there’s a
            good chance you’ll use it at some point in your career.</p>

        <p><b>Mini-tutorial:</b> How to use a Kanban board</p>
        <p>If you’ve never used a Kanban board before, here’s an ultra-<br>quick tutorial on how they work:</p>
        <ol class="tutorial">
            <li>Create a new board in your Kanban tool of choice.</li>
            <li>Give your new project a name!</li>
            <li>Create columns for each stage of development.
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.”</li>
                    <li>You can add or remove columns as needed, so play<br> around with creating a workflow that
                        fits
                        you!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Create cards for each task in your project and add them<br> to the appropriate columns.
                <ol>
                    <li>For example, if you’re working on a website, you<br> might have cards for “Design home
                        page,”
                        “Write<br> About Us page,” or “Create a contact form.”</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Move completed tasks over to the “Done” column. This<br> will help you track your progress and see
                what
                still needs<br> to be done.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p>You can also add due dates, comments, and attachments to your cards to make them<br> more informative.
        And,
        if you’re working on a team project, you can assign cards to<br> specific team members!</p>



    <h2>2. Track your time: Clockify, Pomodoro, Rubber Ducking</h2>
    <p>The next step is to start conscientiously managing your time. There are many different<br> ways to do
        this,
        but the three popular methods are using a time tracker (like Clockify),<br> Rubber Ducking, and the
        Pomodoro
        Technique.</p>
    <div class="clock">
        <img src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/5978320472899584/image/download/5810956133466112" width="100px"
            height="100px">
        <p class="clock2"><a href="https://clockify.me/" target="_blank">Clockify</a>
            is a free time-tracking tool that allows you to track how much time you spend on each task. It’s great
            for
            getting an accurate picture of how long each task actually takes, and it can be a valuable resource for
            planning future projects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="duck">
        <p class="duck2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Ducking</a> is a technique
            that
            involves
            using a rubber<br> duck (or any other small object) as a stand-in for your project<br> manager. When
            you’re
            working on a task, you explain what<br> you’re doing to the duck. This helps you to clarify your
            thoughts<br> and can prevent you from getting stuck. If you find yourself<br> spending more than a few
            minutes stuck on a problem, it’s a<br> good idea to take a break and Rubber Duck it.</p>

        <p class="tomato2">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">Pomodoro
                Technique</a> is
            a
            time management technique<br> that involves working on a task for 25 minutes and then taking<br> a
            5-minute
            break. This helps to keep you focused and prevents<br> you from getting burnt out. After four Pomodoros,
            you
            take a<br> longer break (15-20 minutes).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Learn to use GitHub!</h2>
    <p>GitHub is a cloud-based Git repository hosting service that allows developers to share<br> their code and
        collaborate on projects.</p>
    <p>Note: Git and GitHub differ in that Git is installed and maintained on your local<br> machine, while
        GitHub
        is entirely cloud-based and can be accessed through the<br> internet.</p>
    <p>Anyone can sign up, and it’s also a great place to learn about <a
            href="https://www.educative.io/blog/five-things-i-wish-id-known-about-git" target="_blank">new
            technologies</a> and find<br> open source projects to contribute to. GitHub can initially seem
        intimidating, especially<br> if you’re completely new to software development. However, it truly is
        worth
        the time<br> and effort to learn how to use it. You can gain experience working on real-world<br>
        projects
        with other developers, and keep track of your progress over time.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub </a> is particularly useful for <b>asynchronous communication</b>
        and
        <b>version control.</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>Asynchronous communication</b> is a way of communication that doesn’t require all parties to be online
        at
        the same time. This is useful for developers because it allows them to collaborate on projects even if
        they’re in different time zones.</p>
    <div class="version">
        <img src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/5978320472899584/image/download/6232269071319040">
        <p class="version2"><b>Version control</b> is a way of keeping track of the changes that<br> are made to a
            project’s
            codebase.
            It’s useful for preventing<br> “merge conflicts,” which can happen when two developers are<br> working
            on
            the same codebase and make different changes.</p>
    </div>
    <p>GitHub also has a feature called <b> “GitHub Issues”</b> which can be used for project<br> management.
        Issues
        are like cards on a Kanban board, and they can be assigned to<br> specific people or groups. This is a
        great
        way to keep track of tasks and ensure that<br> everyone is on the same page!</p>
    <p>Note: If you’re on a team that already uses a tool like Jira or Trello, GitHub can<br> still be a
        valuable
        resource for creating and organizing documentation for your<br> projects.</p>


    <h2>What is the software development life<br> cycle (SDLC)?</h2>
    <div class="sdlc">
        <p class="sdlc2">The software development life cycle (SDLC) is the process<br> software developers use to
            create, test,
            and
            deploy new<br> software applications.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are many different SDLC models, but the Waterfall<br> model is popular for beginners. This model
            involves six steps:<br> requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing,<br> deployment, and
            maintenance.
        </p>
        <img src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/5978320472899584/image/download/4680905140731904" width="100px"

            height="100px">
        <ul class="work2">
            <li><b>Requirements gathering</b> is the first step in the SDLC. This<br> is when developers work with
                stakeholders to determine<br> what the new software application should do.</li>
            <li><b>Design</b> is the second step in the SDLC. This is when<br> developers create a plan for how the
                new
                software<br> application will be built.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <ul class="motive2">
            <li><b>Implementation</b> is the third step in the SDLC. This is when<br> developers start writing code
                for
                the new software<br> application.</li>
            <li><a href="Testing "></a> is the fourth step in the SDLC. This is when<br> developers test the new
                software application to ensure it<br> works as expected.</li>
            <li><b>Deployment</b> is the fifth step in the SDLC. This is when the<br> new software application is
                made
                available to users.</li>
            <li><b>Maintenance</b> is the sixth and final step in the SDLC. This is<br> when developers fix bugs and
                make improvements to the<br> new software application.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/5978320472899584/image/download/5632498765922304" width="200px"
            height="200px">
    </div>

    <div class="note22">
        <p>When you’re managing a project, your goal is to complete all of the steps in the SDLC as<br> efficiently
            as
            possible. To do this, you need to have <b>solid time management skills</b> and<br> know how to <b>
                prioritize tasks.</b></p>
        <p>If you’re the kind of person who thrives in structured environments, then combining<br> an SDLC method
            with a
            combination of project management tools could be the key to<br> accelerating your learning,
            productivity,
            and project success.</p>
        <p>Of course, this is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Everyone has different learning styles,<br> and what
            works for one person might not work for another!</p>
        <p class="note2">Note: The waterfall method is just one of many SDLC models. Other examples<br> include the
            Agile
            method,
            Spiral model, and DevOps model.</p>

        <h2>Wrapping up and next steps</h2>
        <p>Project management is a critical part of any software development project. It’s how developers manage the
            expectations of their clients and deliver a final product that satisfies everyone. Learning how to use
            project management tools can help you stay on top of your workflow and deliver a final product that meet
            your client’s needs.</p>
        <p>Whether you’re a new developer looking to switch careers, or just someone who wants to know more about
            how
            projects are managed in tech, familiarizing yourself with the non-technical side of software development
            will not only help you better understand the process behind creating an app or website but will also
            prepare
            for any future roles you may want to pursue within your company. When you know how software development
            works from start to finish, you can be a more effective developer who contributes a ton of value to your
            team.</p>
